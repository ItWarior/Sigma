Simple Blog application which provides next functionality:
- Authentication

## Authentication
Out of the box users have restricted permissions, and basically can only see posts.
But, we provide the ability to create own user which will open rich functionality of the Application.

## Posts
Basically, users can see all posts created in the system. We provide the functionality for authenticated
users to create own posts.

We provide the functionality of user management, which means that you can create own user
and update or delete that later.
As additional functionality we set up Admin user which has extended set of permissions.
